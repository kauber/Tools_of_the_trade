- In name_normalizer, args should be optional, if we don't want to replace, we cannot pass the list with strings
to replace

- Add exception handling

- option to pass a list with strings to remove OK

- vectorised version of string matching (?)

- add requirements.txt

- filter name matching dataset by similarity score (e.g. above 90, add as a param to fuzzy matcher)

- post processor:
 a) keep highest similarity score when multiple matches (there might be multiple matches of the same name)
 b) set threshold

- the 'normalization' param in fuzzy_matcher does not seem to do much

- the name_normalizer generates a new dataset with the 2 columns that we're passing, but we need to think about this
choice, for instance in the post processor. often what we want to do is rejoin the data back to the original datasets,
so we should have normalized names there as well? or shall we just leave it like that for the user to complete?
