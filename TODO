- Add exception handling

- vectorised version of string matching (?)

- the name_normalizer generates a new dataset with the 2 columns that we're passing, but we need to think about this
choice, for instance in the post processor. often what we want to do is rejoin the data back to the original datasets,
so we should have normalized names there as well? or shall we just leave it like that for the user to complete?
